# Lost-Unity
Unity Rewrite for Lost, with more features!

## What Happened
I wasn't happy with how I did things in Bevy and I didn't want to start from scratch, so I'm redoing everything in Unity.

## Features 
* Director - Not Complete, requires some love, but good for testing
* Enemies - Not Complete
* Networking - Not Complete, clients can connect but doesn't work correctly
* Player Classes - 1/9 Classes complete
